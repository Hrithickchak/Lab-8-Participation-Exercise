Lab Exercise

• Implement has city, delete city, and count cities (same as lab 6), however, this time using TDD.

• Create each functionality one at a time, creating (and pushing) a test to create a failing build, before adding functionality to make it pass.

• e.g., create hasCity test, push for failing build, write functionality for hasCity to make passing build. Repeat for delete city and count cities.

Please submit the link to your repo/fork.
